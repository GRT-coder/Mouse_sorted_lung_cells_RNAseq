This analysis correspond to an ongoing project to study different lung subsets from databases and experimental data to analyze Isthmin-1. ISM1 is a secreted protein highly expressed in mouse lungs, also this protein is related to hematopoiesis in zebra fish and in mouse lung progenitors.

ENA projects listed were downloaded, quality assesed by FastQc, trimmed and filtered with AfterQC. After quality control, files were quatified with Salmon using the genome assembly  GRCm38 from Ensembl. The following script used Salmon Quants (file.sf) and R tools like txtimport and DESeq to annotate and analyse them.
